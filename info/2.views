we saw function view 

now lets see class based view 
List view , detail view , update view , delete...

as the name suggest it is same 

///////////
in detail view django provide us a variable in routes !!

create view mai template post_form - hai

can not use decorator in view class thus - we use mixins - LoginRequiredMixin;

UserPassesTestMixin - khud ka hi post update kare dusro ka nhi
require a function to check
