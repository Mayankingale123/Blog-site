query in python 
python manage.py shell
 from blog.models import Post
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User

// get all User
User.objects.all();
    post_2 = Post(title='Blog 2',content='User 2Post Content!', author=user[1]) 


//flash message 
displayed one when we get data

//redirect to home page

crispy form ??why - adding style to the form as if we do it in backend all thing is mix up

for including it we- setting.py - bydefault use bootstrap2

for login - by default from django views as auth_views
and same logout
it does all back end and from end logic but we have to make templates

isAuthanticated - login hai ya nhi check karne ke liye

if you are not loged in then can not acces to feature
users.views.py def profile

decorators @login_required - login is required to acces this page

/////////////////////////////
profile
django not provide profile picture by default
we want one to one 
os we extand user model


 
#path of folder where to store uploaded file
MEDIA_ROOT= os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

django signal - jese he user create ho by default profile ban jaye default image uploaded ho jae

 enctype="multipart/form-data"

 now we have to add update feature 
 such that we can update image,username,email
--how??

we do this by creating form //Model form
